Fluidity is a rapid Umbraco user interface builder for custom data structures configured via a fluent API. 

If you have a custom data store that you’d like to be able to content manage from within Umbraco then Fluidity will allow you quickly configure a custom management user interface, reusing many core components and with a consistent look and feel, in just a few lines of code. 

With Fluidity, custom data user interfaces can now take a matter of minutes, rather than days.
